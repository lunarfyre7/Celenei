# Bean-FW
Bean-FW is a modular open source firmware for Arduino. At present it is a general purpose framework with simple task scheduling and UI features.

**This readme is not finished AT ALL, the code isn't either, so don't use it yet!**

# Building
Use the eclipse arduino plugin, follow the setup instructions, and finally clone the project into your workspace.
*only tested on an Arduino UNO*
