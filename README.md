# Solaneae
Solaneae (solan-ee-I) is a modular open source firmware for Arduino. At present it is a general purpose framework with simple task scheduling and UI features.

**This readme is not finished AT ALL, and there is no documentation, nor is the code ready for people to use it**

# Building
Use the eclipse arduino plugin, follow the setup instructions, and finally clone the project into your workspace.
*only tested on an Arduino UNO*

# Licence 
Currently the licence is GPL, this is subject to change though.
